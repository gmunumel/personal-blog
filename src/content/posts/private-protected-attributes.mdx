# Private and Protected Attributes in Python

Python does not provide keywords for public, protected, or private attributes like some other
programming languages. Instead, it relies on naming conventions to indicate the intended
visibility of class attributes. This is because Python follows the principle:

> We are all consenting adults here.

Stated by Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python. This principle suggests that Python trusts
developers to follow conventions rather than enforcing strict access controls.

## Understanding Access Control in Python

You may wonder: without any explicit visibility modifiers, how can we manage access to class internals?
Python uses a simple naming convention to indicate the intended visibility of attributes:

- **Public attributes**: Are defined normally and can be accessed from outside the class.
- **Protected attributes**: Are prefixed with a single underscore (e.g., `_protected_attr`) and
  are intended for internal use within the class and its subclasses.
- **Private attributes**: Are prefixed with double underscores (e.g., `__private_attr`) and are intended
  to be inaccessible from outside the class.

With the following code, we can illustrate these concepts:

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.public_attr = "I am public"
        self._protected_attr = "I am protected"
        self.__private_attr = "I am private"

    def get_private_attr(self):
        return self.__private_attr

    def set_private_attr(self, value):
        self.__private_attr = value

    def show_attributes(self):
        print(f"Public: {self.public_attr}")
        print(f"Protected: {self._protected_attr}")
        print(f"Private: {self.get_private_attr()}")
        print()

obj = MyClass()
obj.show_attributes()

print(obj.public_attr)
print(obj._protected_attr)
try:
    print(obj.__private_attr)
except AttributeError as e:
    print(e)

print()
obj.set_private_attr("New private value")
obj.show_attributes()

print(obj.__dict__)
print(obj._MyClass__private_attr)
```

As shown above, public attributes are accessible directly, protected attributes are accessible but
intended for internal use, and private attributes raise an `AttributeError` if accessed directly from
outside the class.

Last couple of lines in the code snippet show that private attributes can still be accessed
using [name mangling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling#Python), which is a feature of Python that changes the name of the private attribute
to include the class name. This is done to prevent accidental access but does not provide true
encapsulation. The `__dict__` attribute of the object shows all attributes, including private ones,
and the private attribute can be accessed using its mangled name (`_MyClass__private_attr`).

## Name Mangling

Name mangling is a way to avoid naming conflicts in subclasses, but it should not be relied upon
for security or strict encapsulation.

Name mangling is applied to attributes that are prefixed with double underscores,
which changes their name to include the class name. This means that if you try to access a
private attribute directly, it will raise an `AttributeError`, but you can still access it
using its mangled name.

```python
class Base:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__private_attr = "Base private"

class Derived(Base):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.__private_attr = "Derived private"

    def show_private_attr(self):
        print(f"Base private attribute: {self._Base__private_attr}")
        print(f"Derived private attribute: {self.__private_attr}")

base = Base()
derived = Derived()
print(base.__dict__)
print(derived.__dict__)
print()
derived.show_private_attr()

try:
    print(derived.__private_attr)
except AttributeError as e:
    print(e)
```

In this example, the `Base` class has a private attribute `__private_attr`, and the `Derived` class
also has a private attribute with the same name. When we try to access `__private_attr` directly from an
instance of `Derived`, it raises an `AttributeError`. However, we can access the base class's private
attribute using its mangled name `_Base__private_attr`. This demonstrates that name mangling is a way to
avoid naming conflicts in subclasses, but it does not provide true encapsulation. The private attribute
in the derived class is still accessible within its own methods.

Name mangling is not universally favored, and some developers prefer to use a single underscore
to indicate protected attributes, which can be accessed from subclasses but are not intended for
external use. This is a matter of preference, but it is important to be consistent in your codebase.

Ian Bicking, a Python developer and the creator of _pip_ and _virtualenv_, defined a [Paste Style Guide](https://paste.readthedocs.io/en/latest/StyleGuide.html#paste-style-guide)
discussing the use of private attributes in Python and the implications of name mangling. He argues:

> Never, ever use two leading underscores. This is annoyingly private. If name clashes are a concern,
> use explicit name mangling instead (e.g., `_MyThing_blahblah`). This is essentially the same thing
> as double-underscore, only itâ€™s transparent where double underscore obscures.

## Getters and Setters

In Python, instead of traditional getter and setter methods, it is more idiomatic to use properties
to control access to attributes. Properties allow you to define methods that can be accessed like attributes,
while still providing the ability to control access or validation.

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self._protected_attr = "Protected"
        self.__private_attr = "Private"

    def get_protected_attr(self):  # ðŸ”´ Avoid: This is not idiomatic in Python, use properties instead
        return self._protected_attr

    @property
    def protected_attr(self):
        return self._protected_attr

    @protected_attr.setter
    def protected_attr(self, value):
        self._protected_attr = value

    @property
    def private_attr(self):
        return self.__private_attr

    @private_attr.setter
    def private_attr(self, value):
        self.__private_attr = value

    def show_attributes(self):
        print(f"Protected: {self.protected_attr}")
        print(f"Private: {self.private_attr}")

obj = MyClass()
obj.show_attributes()
obj.protected_attr = "New Protected Value"
obj.private_attr = "New Private Value"
obj.show_attributes()
```

In this example, we define properties for the protected and private attributes. The `@property` decorator
allows us to access the attributes like regular attributes, while the setter methods allow us to modify
the values. This approach provides a clean and Pythonic way to manage access to class attributes
while still allowing for encapsulation and validation.

Avoid declaring a getter method as `get_protected_attr` or `get_private_attr`, as this is not idiomatic
in Python.

## Best Practices

When working with private and protected attributes in Python, consider the following best practices:

- **Use Single Underscore for Protected Attributes**: Use a single underscore prefix (e.g., `_protected_attr`) to indicate
  that an attribute is intended for internal use within the class and its subclasses.
- **Use Double Underscore for Name Mangling**: Prefix with double underscores
  (e.g., `__private_attr`) only when necessary to avoid name clashes in subclasses. **But only if necessary**.
- **Avoid Overusing Private Attributes**: Relying too heavily on private attributes can lead to tightly coupled
  code. Consider whether an attribute truly needs to be private or if it can be made public or protected.
- **Be Consistent**: Whatever conventions you choose to follow, be consistent throughout your codebase
  to maintain readability and understandability.
- **Avoid Getter and Setter Methods**: Python encourages direct access to attributes, so avoid creating
  unnecessary getter and setter methods. Instead, use properties if you need to control access or validation.

# Conclusion

While Python lacks built-in access modifiers, its naming conventions offer a consistent and effective
way to manage attribute visibility and encapsulation. By following these conventions, developers can
effectively manage access to class internals and maintain encapsulation.
