# Handle Multiple Bounded Contexts

In **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, a **bounded context** defines the boundaries within which a particular model is defined and applicable.
When dealing with multiple bounded contexts, it's crucial to maintain clear boundaries and ensure that each context can progress independently.
One way to achieve this is by using **domain events**, allowing different bounded contexts to communicate without tight coupling. But is not the only way to do it.

In this article, we will explore how to handle multiple bounded contexts in Python using domain events, along with some alternative approaches.

## What is a Bounded Context?

A **bounded context** is a conceptual boundary within which a specific domain model is defined and applicable.
It helps to isolate different parts of a system, allowing each part to advance individually without affecting others.
Bounded contexts are essential for managing complexity and ensuring that different parts of the system can communicate effectively.

According to Eric Evans, the author of _Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software_:

> A bounded context is a boundary within which a particular model is defined and applicable.
> It provides a clear separation between different parts of the system, allowing each part to evolve independently.

A bounded context can be thought of as a specific area of the system where a particular model is valid and applicable.

      Two Contexts with a common Aggregate
    </figcaption>
  </div>
</figure>

The figure above illustrates two contexts, each with its own model.
However, they share a common aggregate, which can lead to challenges in maintaining consistency
and communication between the contexts. For _Finance Context_, the `Account` aggregate might represent a bank account with specific attributes and behaviors,
while for _Human Resources Context_, the same `Account` aggregate might represent an employee account with different
attributes and behaviors.

If we scale this up to a larger system, we might have multiple bounded contexts,
each with its own model, but sharing common entities or concepts. According
to [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html): try to do a total unification of these models will not be feasible or cost-effective, which could lead to a monolithic architecture.

So, how can we handle multiple bounded contexts in Python while ensuring clear
boundaries and effective communication?

The possible solutions include:

- **Embrace Independence**: Allow each bounded context to evolve independently, even if it means duplicating some entities or concepts.
- **Context Map**: Introduce a translation layer to protect your model from being corrupted.
- **Shared Kernel**: Defining a shared kernel that contains common entities and concepts used by multiple bounded contexts.
- **Separate Context**: Implementing a separate context for shared entities when they do not belong to any specific bounded context.
- **Anti Corruption Layer (ACL)**: Using an anti-corruption layer to translate between different bounded contexts, and protect your model from being corrupted by external changes.
- **Domain Events**: Using domain events to communicate between bounded contexts, allowing them to remain loosely coupled.

## Embrace Independence

One of the simplest ways to handle multiple bounded contexts is to embrace independence.
This means allowing each bounded context to progress individually, even if it means duplicating some entities or concepts.

Usually the issue
arises because both teams use the same _term_ but mean different things in their respective contexts. Refine the **Ubiquitous Language**
to avoid this issue.

This approach can lead to a more modular and flexible architecture, as each bounded context can be developed and deployed independently.
However, it can also lead to duplication of code and data, which can increase complexity and maintenance costs.

<figure className="article-figure flex flex-col items-center">
  ![Two Contexts with independent Entities](/handle-multiple-bounded-contexts/embrace_independence.png)
  <div>
    <figcaption className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-1 text-center">
      Two Contexts with independent Entities
    </figcaption>
  </div>
</figure>

In the example of the _Finance Context_ and _Human Resources Context_, we could have two separate `Account` entities, each with its own attributes and behaviors.
In Python the name of the aggregate can be the same, but they will be defined in different modules or classes.

```python
# src/application/domain/model/finance/account.py
class Account:
    def __init__(self, account_id, balance):
        self.account_id = account_id
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount <= self.balance:
            self.balance -= amount
        else:
            print("Insufficient funds")

    def print_balance(self):
        print(f"Account {self.account_id} has a balance of {self.balance}")

finance_account = Account(account_id="12345", balance=1000)
finance_account.deposit(500)
finance_account.print_balance()
finance_account.withdraw(200)
finance_account.print_balance()
finance_account.withdraw(1500)
```

The `Account` class in the _Finance Context_ with methods to deposit, withdraw, and print the balance.
This class is independent of the _Human Resources Context_, allowing it to evolve without affecting the other context.

```python
# src/application/domain/model/hr/account.py
class Account:
    def __init__(self, employee_id, salary):
        self.employee_id = employee_id
        self.salary = salary

    def pay_salary(self):
        print(f"Paying salary of {self.salary} to employee {self.employee_id}")

hr_account = Account(employee_id="67890", salary=3000)
hr_account.pay_salary()
```

The class `Account` in the _Human Resources Context_ has its own attributes and methods, allowing it to manage employee accounts independently.

If for some reason you need to use both in the same file you can use an alias to differentiate them:

```python
# no-run
# src/main.py
from src.finance.domain.model.account import Account as FinanceAccount
from src.hr.domain.model.account import Account as HRAccount

finance_account = FinanceAccount(account_id="12345", balance=1000)
hr_account = HRAccount(employee_id="67890", salary=3000)
```

The implementation above imports the `Account` class from both contexts and uses aliases to differentiate them.
This approach allows you to maintain clear boundaries between the contexts while still being able to use the same name for the aggregate.

Both models are _locally related_ but serve different purposes in their respective contexts.

## Context Map

A **context map** is a way to define the relationships between different bounded contexts and how they communicate with each other.
It provides a clear separation between different parts of the system, allowing each part to develop individually while still being able to communicate effectively.
Result would be a coherent dialect of the **Ubiquitous Language** across the system.

Steps to implement a context map:

1. **Identify Bounded Contexts**: Identify the different bounded contexts in your system and their boundaries.
2. **Define Relationships**: Define the relationships between the bounded contexts, including how they communicate and share data.
3. **Implement Context Map**: Implement a context map that defines the relationships and communication patterns between the bounded contexts.

A context map can be implemented in Python by defining a separate module or package that contains the definitions of the relationships between different bounded contexts.

<figure className="article-figure flex flex-col items-center">
  ![Context Map](/handle-multiple-bounded-contexts/context_map.png)
  <div>
    <figcaption className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-1 text-center">
      Context Map
    </figcaption>
  </div>
</figure>

The figure above illustrates a context map that defines the relationships between the _Finance Context_ and _Human Resources Context_.

```python
# no-run
# src/common/account_translator.py
from src.finance.domain.model.account import Account as FinanceAccount
from src.hr.domain.model.account import Account as HrAccount

class AccountTranslator:
    @staticmethod
    def finance_to_hr(finance_account: FinanceAccount) -> HrAccount:
        return HrAccount(
            employee_id=finance_account.account_id,
            salary=finance_account.balance
        )

    @staticmethod
    def hr_to_finance(hr_account: HrAccount) -> FinanceAccount:
        return FinanceAccount(
            account_id=hr_account.employee_id,
            balance=hr_account.salary
        )

finance_acc = FinanceAccount(account_id="F123", balance=1000)
hr_acc = AccountTranslator.finance_to_hr(finance_acc)
print(f"FinanceAccount -> HrAccount: {hr_acc}")

hr_acc2 = HrAccount(employee_id="E456", salary=5000)
finance_acc2 = AccountTranslator.hr_to_finance(hr_acc2)
print(f"HrAccount -> FinanceAccount: {finance_acc2}")
```

The `AccountTranslator` class that provides methods to translate between the `FinanceAccount` and `HrAccount` entities.
This allows the two bounded contexts to communicate without tight coupling, ensuring that each context can advance independently. _This is the object that both
teams have to work together to maintain._

A context map is a simplified version of <a href="#anti-corruption-layer-acl">Anti Corruption Layer (ACL)</a>.

## Shared Kernel

A **shared kernel** is a way to define a common set of entities and concepts that are used by multiple bounded contexts. Teams agree upfront on this process,
allowing them to share a common understanding of the entities and concepts used in the system. Teams must share _only a small, stable part_ of the
model, which is the shared kernel.

The following figure illustrates a shared kernel that contains common entities and concepts used by both the _Finance Context_ and _Human Resources Context_,
in this case the `Record` aggregate in _Monitor Context_.

<figure className="article-figure flex flex-col items-center">
  ![Shared Kernel](/handle-multiple-bounded-contexts/shared_kernel.png)
  <div>
    <figcaption className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-1 text-center">
      Shared Kernel
    </figcaption>
  </div>
</figure>

Following the example of the _Finance Context_ and _Human Resources Context_, we can define a `Record` aggregate in a shared kernel that both contexts can use.

```python
# no-run
# src/shared/kernel/record.py
class Record:
    def __init__(self, record_id, description):
        self.record_id = record_id
        self.description = description

    def display(self):
        print(f"Record ID: {self.record_id}, Description: {self.description}")

record = Record(record_id="R001", description="Shared Record")
record.display()
```

The code above defines a `Record` class in the shared kernel that can be used by both the _Finance Context_ and _Human Resources Context_.
This allows both contexts to share a common understanding of the `Record` aggregate.

A shared kernel is often the **Core Domain** of the system, where both teams have to work together to maintain it.

## Separate Context

Another approach to handling multiple bounded contexts is to implement a separate context for shared entities. In this case, the shared
aggregate does not belong to any specific bounded context, but rather exists in its own context. We should promote it to its own bounded
context and treat others as consumers of its API or events.

<figure className="article-figure flex flex-col items-center">
  ![Separate Context](/handle-multiple-bounded-contexts/separate_context.png)
  <div>
    <figcaption className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-1 text-center">
      Separate Context
    </figcaption>
  </div>
</figure>

In the example of the _Finance Context_ and _Human Resources Context_, we could have a separate context for the `Account` aggregate that both contexts can use _Account Management Context_.
They communicate with this context through its API or events, allowing them to remain loosely coupled.

```python
# no-run
# src/application/domain/services/account_management.py
class AccountManagement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.accounts = {}

    def create_account(self, account_id, balance, salary):
        self.accounts[account_id] = {"balance": balance, "salary": salary}
        print(f"Account {account_id} created with balance {balance} and salary {salary}")

    def remove_account(self, account_id):
        if account_id in self.accounts:
            del self.accounts[account_id]
            print(f"Account {account_id} removed")
        else:
            print(f"Account {account_id} not found")
```

The `AccountManagement` class provides methods to create, get balance, and remove accounts.
This allows both the _Finance Context_ and _Human Resources Context_ to use the same `AccountManagement` context without tight coupling.

## Anti Corruption Layer (ACL)

An **Anti Corruption layer (ACL)** is a pattern used to protect your model from being corrupted by external changes.
It acts as a translation layer between different bounded contexts, allowing them to communicate without tight coupling.
This pattern is particularly useful when dealing with legacy systems or external APIs that do not align with your domain model.

The ACL consist of:

- **Translators**: Classes or functions that convert data between different models or formats.
- **Adapters**: Classes or functions that adapt the interface of one bounded context to another, allowing them to communicate effectively.
- **Interfaces**: Define clear interfaces for communication between bounded contexts.
- **Services**: Provide a way to encapsulate the logic for interacting with other bounded contexts.

The following figure illustrates an ACL that translates between the _Finance Context_ and _Human Resources Context_.

<figure className="article-figure flex flex-col items-center">
  ![Anti Corruption Layer](/handle-multiple-bounded-contexts/anti_corruption_layer.png)
  <div>
    <figcaption className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-1 text-center">
      Anti Corruption Layer. the _U_ stands for Upstream, <br />
      _D_ stands for Downstream, _OHS_ stands for Open Host Service, <br />
      and _PL_ stands for Published Language
    </figcaption>
  </div>
</figure>

In the above figure, the ACL acts as a protection layer between the _Finance Context_ and _Account Management Context_,
and _Human Resources Context_ and _Account Management Context_.

But what is a Open Host Service and Published Language?

### Open Host Service (OHS)

An **Open Host Service (OHS)** is a service that provides a well-defined interface for other bounded contexts to interact with it.
It allows other contexts to access its functionality without needing to understand its internal workings. Enhance and expand
the interface to handle new integration requirements.

### Published Language (PL)

A **Published Language (PL)** is a common language or format used by multiple bounded contexts to communicate with each other.
Use a well-defined shared language that can express the necessary domain information as a common medium of communication.
Published Language is often combined with Open Host Service to provide a clear and consistent way for different contexts to interact.

Below is a zoom in figure of the ACL that illustrates the different components.

<figure className="article-figure flex flex-col items-center">
  ![Zoom in Anti Corruption Layer for Human Resources Context and Account Management Context](/handle-multiple-bounded-contexts/anti_corruption_layer_2.png)

    <figcaption className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-1 text-center">
      Zoom in Anti Corruption Layer for _Human Resources Context_ <br />
      and _Account Management Context_
    </figcaption>
  </div>
</figure>

There is a `HTTPClient (Facade)` that acts as a facade for the _Account Management Context_. A `AccountAdapter` that provides
an interface for the _Human Resources Context_ to interact with the _Account Management Context_, `AccountTranslator` that provides
methods to translate between the `HrAccount` and `AccountManagementAccount` entities, and an `AccountService` that acts as an anti-corruption
layer for the _Human Resources Context_ and _Account Management Context_.

We created a `acl` package within the _Human Resources Context_ to contain the ACL components. The following components are
included in the ACL: **AccountAdapter**, **AccountTranslator**, and **HTTPClient (Facade)**.

We take advantage of [Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) such as **Adapter**,
**Translator**, and **Facade** to implement the ACL. Allowing us to
maintain clear boundaries between the _Human Resources Context_ and _Account Management Context_,
while still enables effective communication.

### Translator

The implementation of the `AccountTranslator` class is straightforward. It provides two static methods for
translating between the `HrAccount` and `AccountManagementAccount` entities.

```python
# no-run
# src/application/domain/model/hr/acl/account_translator.py
from src.application.domain.model.hr.account import Account as HrAccount
from src.application.domain.model.account_management.account import Account as AccountManagementAccount

class AccountTranslator:
    @staticmethod
    def hr_to_account_management(hr_account: HrAccount) -> AccountManagementAccount:
        return AccountManagementAccount(
            account_id=hr_account.employee_id,
            salary=hr_account.salary,
            balance=0
        )

    @staticmethod
    def account_management_to_hr(account_management_account: AccountManagementAccount) -> HrAccount:
        return HrAccount(
            employee_id=account_management_account.account_id,
            salary=account_management_account.balance
        )
```

The `AccountTranslator` class provides methods to translate between the `HrAccount` and `AccountManagementAccount` entities.
This allows the _Human Resources Context_ to communicate with the _Account Management Context_ using a common
language (PL), ensuring that both contexts can evolve independently without affecting each other.

### Adapter

The `AccountAdapter` class provides an interface for the _Human Resources Context_ to interact with the _Account Management Context_.

```python
# no-run
# src/application/domain/model/hr/acl/account_adapter.py
from src.application.domain.model.hr.acl.account_translator import AccountTranslator

class AccountAdapter:
    def __init__(self, account_management_facade):
        self.account_management_facade = account_management_facade

    def create_hr_account(self, hr_account):
        account_management_account = AccountTranslator.hr_to_account_management(
            hr_account
        )
        return self.account_management_facade.create_account(account_management_account)

    def remove_hr_account(self, hr_account):
        return self.account_management_facade.remove_account(hr_account.employee_id)
```

The `AccountAdapter` class provides an interface for the _Human Resources Context_ to interact with the _Account Management Context_.
This allows the _Human Resources Context_ to create and remove accounts in the _Account Management Context_ without needing to understand its internal workings.
The translator `AccountTranslator` is used to convert a `HrAccount` to `AccountManagementAccount`.


### HTTP Client (Facade)

Our Open Host Service is a HTTP client to interact with the _Account Management Context_.

```python
# no-run
# src/application/domain/model/hr/acl/http_client.py
import requests

class HttpClient:
    def __init__(self, base_url):
        self.base_url = base_url

    def create_account(self, account_id, balance, salary):
        response = requests.post(
            f"{self.base_url}/accounts",
            json={"account_id": account_id, "balance": balance, "salary": salary}
        )
        return response.json()

    def remove_account(self, account_id):
        response = requests.delete(f"{self.base_url}/accounts/{account_id}")
        return response.status_code
```

The `HttpClient` class provides an HTTP client to interact with the _Account Management Context_.
This allows the _Human Resources Context_ to create and remove accounts in the _Account Management Context_ using HTTP requests, ensuring that both contexts can communicate effectively without tight coupling.

### Account Service

Finally, we can implement the `AccountService` class, which acts as an anti-corruption layer for
the _Human Resources Context_ and _Account Management Context_. This class is
within the _Human Resources Context_ and not in `acl` package.

```python
# no-run
# src/application/domain/service/hr/account_service.py
from src.application.domain.model.hr.account import Account as HrAccount
from src.application.domain.model.account_management.account import Account as AccountManagementAccount
from src.application.domain.model.hr.acl.account_translator import AccountTranslator

class AccountService:
    def __init__(self, account_management_service):
        self.http_client = HttpClient(base_url="http://localhost:8000")
        self.account_adapter = AccountAdapter(self.http_client)

    def maintain_account(self, hr_account: HrAccount):
        return self.account_adapter.create_hr_account(hr_account)
```

The `AccountService` class provides a method to maintain accounts in the _Account Management Context_.
This method uses the `AccountAdapter` to create a new account in the _Account Management Context_.

Following is the sequence diagram that illustrates the interaction between the _Human Resources Context_ and _Account Management Context_ using the ACL.

```mermaid
// title: Sequence Diagram - Anti Corruption Layer (ACL)
// caption: Sequence of creating an account from Human Resources Context to Account Management Context via ACL.
// css: w-full h-full bg-white py-3
sequenceDiagram
    participant HR as Human Resources<br/>Context
    participant Service as AccountService
    participant Adapter as AccountAdapter
    participant Translator as AccountTranslator
    participant Http as HttpClient (Facade)
    participant AMC as Account Management<br/>Context

    HR->>Service: maintain_account(hr_account)
    Service->>Adapter: create_account(hr_account)
    Adapter->>Translator: hr_to_account_management(hr_account)
    Translator-->>Adapter: account_management_account
    Adapter->>Http: create_account(account_id, balance, salary)
    Http->>AMC: POST /accounts
    AMC-->>Http: Account created
    Http-->>Adapter: Response
    Adapter-->>Service: Result
    Service-->>HR: Done
```

The sequence diagram illustrates the interaction between the _Human Resources Context_ and _Account Management Context_ using the ACL.
The `AccountService` calls the `AccountAdapter`, which uses the `AccountTranslator` to translate the `HrAccount` to `AccountManagementAccount`.
The `AccountAdapter` then uses the `HttpClient` to create the account in the _Account Management Context_.
This allows both contexts to communicate effectively without tight coupling, ensuring that each context can evolve independently.

## Domain Events

Domain events are a powerful way to handle multiple bounded contexts in Python.
They allow different bounded contexts to communicate without tight coupling, ensuring that each context can evolve independently.
Domain events are used to notify other bounded contexts about changes in the system, allowing them to react to those changes
without needing to know the details of the other context.

There are common phrases that help us identify when to use domain events:

- "When..."
- "If something happens..."
- "Inform me when..." or "Notify me when..."

But first we need to define what an Aggregate is.

### Aggregate

An **Aggregate** is a cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit.
When an aggregate changes its state, it can publish a domain event to notify other bounded contexts about the change.
Aggregates are idempotent, meaning that they can be applied multiple times without changing the outcome. The entry point
to an aggregate is defined as **Aggregate Root**. But must not communicate with other aggregates directly other than the
Aggregate Root. This ensures that the aggregate is treated as a single unit and that its state is consistent.

<figure className="article-figure flex flex-col items-center">
  ![Aggregate - A cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit](/handle-multiple-bounded-contexts/aggregate.png)
  <div>
    <figcaption className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-1 text-center">
      Aggregate - A cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single
      unit
    </figcaption>
  </div>
</figure>

The figure above illustrates an aggregate root named `Keyboard`,
where `KeyCap`, `Switch` and `Position` are domain objects that can be treated as a single unit. There is not allow communication
between an `User` and `Switch` directly, but only through the `Keyboard` aggregate root.

Domain events are usually defined over aggregates because they represent a significant change in the state of the system.
When an aggregate changes its state, it can publish a domain event to notify other bounded contexts about the change.

Steps to implement domain events using aggregates:

1. Cluster the **Entities** and **Value Objects** into **Aggregates** and define boundaries around them.
2. Choose one **Entity** to be the **Aggregate Root**.
3. Control all access to the objects inside the boundary through the root.
4. Allow external objects to hold references to the root only.

The following figure illustrates how domain events can be used to handle a single aggregate.

<figure className="article-figure flex flex-col items-center">
  ![Domain Events](/handle-multiple-bounded-contexts/domain_events.png)
  <div>
    <figcaption className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-1 text-center">
      Domain Events
    </figcaption>
  </div>
</figure>

Coming back to the example of the _Finance Context_ and _Human Resources Context_, every time a new account is created in
_Human Resources Context_, a domain event is published to notify the _Finance Context_ about the change. We will need the following
changes:

- Define a `Dispatcher` that will be responsible for dispatching domain events to the appropriate handlers.
- Define an `AccountCreated` domain event that contains the necessary information about the account.
- Update `HrAccount` class to publish the `AccountCreated` domain event when a new account is created.
- Update `FinanceAccount` class to handle the `AccountCreated` domain event and update its state accordingly.

In the following implementation I will assume that the _Human Resources Context_ is responsible for creating the account,
and the _Finance Context_ is responsible for handling the account balance. 
The aggregate root will be the `Account` aggregate in the _Human Resources Context_.

```python
# no-run
# src/domain_event/dispatcher.py
class DomainEventDispatcher:
    def __init__(self):
        self._subscribers = {}

    def subscribe(self, event_type, handler):
        if event_type not in self._subscribers:
            self._subscribers[event_type] = []
        self._subscribers[event_type].append(handler)

    def publish(self, event):
        event_type = type(event)
        handlers = self._subscribers.get(event_type, [])
        for handler in handlers:
            handler(event)

# Singleton instance for global use
dispatcher = DomainEventDispatcher()
```

The `DomainEventDispatcher` class is responsible for dispatching domain events to the appropriate handlers.
There is a singleton instance of the dispatcher that can be used globally.

```python
# no-run
# src/domain_event/account_created.py
class AccountCreated:
    def __init__(self, account_id, balance, salary):
        self.account_id = account_id
        self.balance = balance
        self.salary = salary
```

The `AccountCreated` class represents a domain event that contains the necessary information about the account.

```python
# no-run
# src/hr/domain/model/account.py
from src.domain_event.dispatcher import dispatcher
from src.domain_event.account_created import AccountCreated

class Account:
    def __init__(self, employee_id, salary):
        self.employee_id = employee_id
        self.salary = salary

    # Other methods...

    def publish_account_created_event(self):
        event = AccountCreated(self.employee_id, self.salary)
        dispatcher.publish(event)
```

The `Account` class in the _Human Resources Context_ is updated to publish the `AccountCreated` domain event when a new account is created.

```python
# no-run
# src/finance/domain/model/account.py
from src.domain_event.account_created import AccountCreated
from src.domain_event.dispatcher import dispatcher

class Account:
    def __init__(self, account_id, balance):
        self.account_id = account_id
        self.balance = balance

    # Other methods...

def handle_account_created_event(self, event: AccountCreated):
    if event.account_id == self.account_id:
        self.balance += event.salary
        print(f"Account {self.account_id} updated with salary {event.salary}. New balance: {self.balance}")

dispatcher.subscribe(AccountCreated, handle_account_created_event)
```

There is a new method `handle_account_created_event` that handles the `AccountCreated` domain event and updates
the state of the `Account` in the _Finance Context_.

Following is the sequence diagram that illustrates the flow of the `AccountCreated` domain event 
from the _Human Resources Context_ to the _Finance Context_.

```mermaid
// title: Sequence Diagram - Domain Events Across Bounded Contexts
// caption: Flow of AccountCreated event from HR to Finance Context.
// css: w-4xl h-full bg-white py-3
sequenceDiagram
    participant HR as HrAccount<br/>(Human Resources Context)
    participant Dispatcher as DomainEventDispatcher
    participant Finance as FinanceAccount<br/>(Finance Context)

    HR->>Dispatcher: publish(AccountCreated)
    Dispatcher->>Finance: handle_account_created_event(AccountCreated)
    Finance->>Finance: Update balance with event.salary
    Finance-->>Dispatcher: (done)
```

`HrAccount` publishes the `AccountCreated` domain event to the `DomainEventDispatcher`.
The `DomainEventDispatcher` then dispatches the event to the `FinanceAccount`, which handles the event and updates its state accordingly.
This allows both contexts to communicate effectively without tight coupling, ensuring

This is my personal favorite approach, as it allows for a more modular and flexible architecture.

## Summary

Handling multiple bounded contexts in Python can be achieved using various approaches,
each with its own advantages and trade-offs. Here are the key takeaways:

# Conclusion

Handling multiple bounded contexts in Python requires careful consideration of the relationships 
between contexts and how they communicate. By embracing independence, defining context maps, 
using shared kernels, implementing separate contexts, utilizing anti-corruption layers, and leveraging domain events,
you can create a modular and flexible architecture that allows each bounded context to evolve 
independently while still being able to communicate effectively.

You can always combine these approaches to suit your specific needs and requirements. Start with the simplest 
approach that meets your needs, and then evolve your architecture as your system grows and changes.
