# Global Object Pattern in Python

Like many other scripting languages, Python provides a way to write implementations that
can be run multiple times. A _module_ is a file containing Python code that can be imported
into other Python scripts. Within a module you can define functions, classes, and variables
that can be accessed from other scripts. Variables that are created outside any object like
functions or classes will have a global scope within the module, and they can be used to
store state or configuration that should be shared across different parts of the application.

There are many constants defined in the Python standard library that are
accessible globally. These constants are defined in various modules and can be used
to provide meaningful names for values that are used throughout the codebase. Most of the time,
developers are not aware of these constants, but they can be very useful to improve code readability
and reusability.

```python
import calendar
import logging
import configparser
import email.utils

January = 1                   # calendar.py
WARNING = 30                  # logging.py
MAX_INTERPOLATION_DEPTH = 10  # configparser.py
TICK = "'"                    # email.utils.py
```

Notice that the constants variables defined above are _constant_ in terms of their memory
store; their names could be changed. In general, assigning a value to a variable is just
other way to label it in memory, and you can change the label at any time, but the memory
allocation maintains intact.

```python
import calendar
calendar.January = 42
print(calendar.January)
```

Or even be deleted.

```python
import calendar
del calendar.January
print(calendar.January)
```

Usually when you see a value like `42` or a string like `Meaningful String` repeating all over your code,
would be a good idea to define it as a constant in a module, so you centralize its definition
and make it easier to change in the future.

## Import-time

When Python runs a script or module, it imports all the modules that are needed to execute the code.
This process is called **import-time**. During import-time, Python executes the code in the module and
creates a global object that contains all the variables, functions, and classes defined in the module.
If your code uses numbers between `-5` and `256`, Python will use a global object to store these values
to avoid creating new objects for each use. This is an optimization technique that helps to reduce
memory usage. This is known as [object interning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/object-interning-in-python/).

```python
a = 100
b = 100
print(id(a))
print(id(b))
print(a is b)
```

In contrast, you can see what happens with larger numbers:

```python
a = 1000
b = 1000
print(id(a))
print(id(b))
print(a is b)
```

The behavior of the global object is not limited to numbers, it also applies to strings and
other immutable objects. You could define a constant in a module that store a complex calculation
and avoid recalculating it every time it is needed. This is a common practice to improve
performance and reduce code duplication.

```python
import math
COMPLEX_CONSTANT = math.sqrt(math.factorial(6) + math.pow(3, 4))
print(id(COMPLEX_CONSTANT))
print(COMPLEX_CONSTANT)
```

## Dunder Constants

If you are a novice Python developer, or even an experienced one, most probably you have
used the `__name__` and `'__main__'` dunder constants. These are special variables that are
defined by Python at runtime and can be used to determine if a module is being run as the main program or
if it is being imported by another module. Dunder constants are defined at a module's global
level and their names start and end with double underscores (`__`). The three most common are:

- `__name__`: A special variable in Python that holds the name of the current module.
  If the file is being run directly, `__name__` is set to `'__main__'`.
  If the file is imported as a module, `__name__` is set to the module’s name.

- `'__main__'`: The string value assigned to `__name__` when a Python file is executed directly.
  This allows code to distinguish between running as a script or being imported.

- `__file__`: A special variable that contains the path to the current file. Useful for
  determining the file’s location on disk.

If you are curious you can list dunder constants in a module using the `dir()` function:

```python
print([name for name in dir(__builtins__) if name.startswith('__') and name.endswith('__')])
```

## Global Object Pattern

The **Global Object Pattern** is visible when a module instantiates an object at import time
and assigns it a name in the module's global scope. But the object is not a simple string, number,
or data structure. Instead, the object exposes methods and properties that can be used to interact
with it.

There are two categories:

- **Immutable Global Object**: This is a global object that is created at import time and
  does not change during the lifetime of the program. It is usually a constant value or a
  configuration object that is used throughout the application.

- **Mutable Global Object**: This is a global object that can change during the lifetime of
  the program. It is usually a singleton object that is used to store state or configuration
  that can be modified by different parts of the application.

An example of a **Immutable Global Object** is a compiled regular expression.

```python
import re
HAS_UTF8 = re.compile(r'[\x00-\x7F]') # json/encoder.py
```

This regular expression is compiled at import time and can be used to check if a string
contains only ASCII characters. However, incurs a performance penalty if the
regular expression is not used frequently, as it is compiled every time the module is imported,
even if it is not used.

An example of a **Mutable Global Object** is the `environ` dictionary inside `os` package.

```python
import os
print(os.environ['PATH'])
os.environ['PATH'] = '/usr/local/bin'
print(os.environ['PATH'])
```

## Conclusion

The Global Object Pattern is a powerful way to manage state and configuration in Python applications.
It allows you to define global variables that can be accessed from anywhere in the application,
and it can be used to create singletons or constants that are shared across different modules.
