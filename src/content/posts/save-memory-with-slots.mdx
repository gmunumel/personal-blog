# Save Memory with `__slots__`

To fully understand the `__slots__` mechanism in Python, we need to first understand how Python handles memory allocation.
Specifically, how it allocates memory dynamically for instance attributes in a class.

## Memory allocation in Python

By default, Python uses a dictionary to store instance attributes, which allows for flexible and dynamic attribute assignment.
You can inspect this information by inspecting the `__dict__` attribute.

```python
class MyClass:
  def __init__(self, attr1, attr2):
    self.attr1 = attr1
    self.attr2 = attr2

my_instance = MyClass(1, 2)
print(my_instance.__dict__)
```

This will output: `{'attr1': 1, 'attr2': 2}`. By definition, [dictionaries in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries) are key-value pairs,
where:

- **keys:** must be immutable types such as _numbers_, _strings_, or _tuples_ (e.g., a `list` is only allowed if its elements are all immutable).
- **values:** can be mutable or immutable and may include combinations like _lists_, _dictionaries_, or _sets_.

The dictionary below uses immutable types for both keys and values. This ensures the reference held by the dictionary always points to the same objects in memory.

In the next image, the dictionary includes a key-value pair where the value is a mutable type (e.g., a `list`). While the
dictionary still holds a reference to the original object, the mutable value `["foo", 42]` breaks immutability. Python must
allocate new memory for such values since it cannot guarantee the value won’t change.

The dynamic nature of dictionaries allows for flexible attribute assignment, but it also has some downsides.
One of the main drawbacks is that dictionaries are not memory-efficient, especially when creating a large number
of instances of a class. This is because each instance of a class with a `__dict__` attribute has its own dictionary,
which can result in significant memory overhead. One alternative is to use the `__slots__` mechanism, which
allows you to explicitly declare data members for a class, leading to substantial memory savings—particularly in large applications with many instances of user-defined classes.

## Using `__slots__` to save memory

The `__slots__` mechanism provides a way to explicitly declare data members for a class,
which can lead to significant memory savings. When a class defines `__slots__`, Python uses a
more memory-efficient internal structure to store instance attributes, eliminating the need for a
per-instance dictionary.

```python
class MyClass:
  __slots__ = ['attr1', 'attr2']

  def __init__(self, attr1, attr2):
    self.attr1 = attr1
    self.attr2 = attr2

my_instance = MyClass(1, 2)
try:
  print(my_instance.__dict__)
except AttributeError:
  print("AttributeError raised")

print(my_instance.attr1)
print(my_instance.attr2)

try:
  my_instance.attr3 = 3
except AttributeError as e:
  print(f"AttributeError: {e}")
```

`__slots__` must be defined at class creation and cannot be added or modified later. The attribute
names can be a `tuple`, `list`, or `set`, but a `list` is most commonly used.

### Subclassing with `__slots__`

When subclassing a class that uses `__slots__`, the subclass must also define its own `__slots__` if it
wants to use the memory-efficient storage. Otherwise, it will use `__dict__` for its attributes.

Below is an example of a subclass that inherits from a class with `__slots__`, but does not define its own `__slots__`:

```python
class BaseClass:
  __slots__ = ['base_attr']

  def __init__(self, base_attr):
    self.base_attr = base_attr

class SubClass(BaseClass):
  pass

sub_instance = SubClass(1)
print(sub_instance.__dict__)

sub_instance.base_attr = 2
print(sub_instance.base_attr)

sub_instance.foo = "bar"
print(sub_instance.__dict__)
```

You can see that the `SubClass` does not define its own `__slots__`, so it inherits the `__slots__` from `BaseClass`.
This means that `SubClass` can access the `base_attr` attribute, but it can also add new attributes dynamically,
which will be stored in the `__dict__` of the instance.

Next the subclass and the base class defines `__slots__`, but with different attributes names:

```python
class BaseClass:
  __slots__ = ['base_attr']

  def __init__(self, base_attr):
    self.base_attr = base_attr

class SubClass(BaseClass):
  __slots__ = ['sub_attr']

  def __init__(self, base_attr, sub_attr):
    super().__init__(base_attr)
    self.sub_attr = sub_attr

base_instance = BaseClass(1)
sub_instance = SubClass(2, 3)

try:
  print(base_instance.__dict__)
except AttributeError as e:
  print(f"AttributeError: {e}")
try:
  print(sub_instance.__dict__)
except AttributeError as e:
  print(f"AttributeError: {e}")

print(base_instance.base_attr)
print(sub_instance.base_attr)
print(sub_instance.sub_attr)
```

In this case, `SubClass` defines its own `__slots__`, which means it can only access the `sub_attr` attribute and the `base_attr` attribute from the `BaseClass`.
This means that `SubClass` cannot add new attributes dynamically, and any attempt to do so will raise an `AttributeError`.

### Measure memory savings

To measure the memory savings achieved by using `__slots__`, we can use
the `sys.getsizeof()` function to compare the memory usage of a class with and without `__slots__`.

```python
import time
import tracemalloc

class MyClassWithSlots:
  __slots__ = ['attr1', 'attr2']

  def __init__(self, attr1, attr2):
    self.attr1 = attr1
    self.attr2 = attr2

class MyClassWithoutSlots:
  def __init__(self, attr1, attr2):
    self.attr1 = attr1
    self.attr2 = attr2

def test_memory_and_time(cls, label):
  print(f"\n--- Testing {label} ---")

  tracemalloc.start()

  mem_before = tracemalloc.get_traced_memory()[0]

  start_time = time.time()
  instances = [cls(i, i + 1) for i in range(1_000_000)]
  end_time = time.time()

  mem_after, peak = tracemalloc.get_traced_memory()

  tracemalloc.stop()

  print(f"{label} - Time taken: {end_time - start_time:.2f}s")
  print(f"{label} - Memory before: {mem_before / 1024 / 1024:.2f} MB")
  print(f"{label} - Memory after: {mem_after / 1024 / 1024:.2f} MB")

  return instances

instances_with_slots = test_memory_and_time(MyClassWithSlots, "With __slots__")
instances_without_slots = test_memory_and_time(MyClassWithoutSlots, "Without __slots__")
```

This will output the memory size of both classes for the creation of 1,000,000 instances,
allowing you to see the difference in memory usage before and after execution.

From the output, you'll notice that the class with `__slots__` uses significantly
less memory than the class without `__slots__`. And the `__slots__` class is faster to create instances,
which is an added performance benefit.

### Limitations of `__slots__`

While `__slots__` can lead to significant memory savings, it also has some limitations:

- **No Dynamic Attributes:** once `__slots__` is defined, you cannot add new attributes dynamically to class instances.
- **Inheritance:** subclasses must define their own `__slots__` to benefit from the same memory optimizations.
- **No Default Values:** default values must be assigned in the `__init__` method; `__slots__` does not support direct default assignments.
- **No Weak References:** instances of classes with `__slots__` cannot be weakly referenced unless you include `weakref` in the slots.
- `@cached_property:` this decorator does not work with `__slots__`, as it relies on `__dict__`. Consider using third-party alternatives like cached-property.

### When to use `__slots__`

Using `__slots__` is particularly beneficial in the following scenarios:

- **Large Number of Instances**: if your application creates a large number of instances of a class,
  using `__slots__` can lead to significant memory savings.
- **Memory-Constrained Environments**: in environments where memory is limited, such as
  embedded systems or low-memory devices, using `__slots__` can help reduce memory usage.
- **Performance-Critical Applications**: if your application requires high performance and
  low memory overhead, using `__slots__` can help improve attribute access speed and reduce memory fragmentation.

### `__slots__` vs. Numpy's `ndarray`

While `__slots__` is a powerful mechanism for optimizing memory usage in Python classes, it is not the only option available.
Numpy's `ndarray` is another powerful tool for efficient memory management, especially when dealing with large datasets or numerical computations.
Numpy's `ndarray` provides a fixed-size, homogeneous array structure that allows for efficient storage and manipulation of large datasets.
However, it is important to note that `__slots__` and Numpy's `ndarray` serve different purposes and are not directly comparable.
Numpy's `ndarray` is designed for [numerical computations](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/whatisnumpy.html#what-is-numpy) and provides a wide range of mathematical operations, while `__slots__` is a
mechanism for optimizing memory usage in Python classes.

## Conclusion

The `__slots__` mechanism in Python provides a way to explicitly declare data members for a class, leading to significant memory savings and performance improvements.
This is particularly useful in applications that create a large number of instances or run in memory-constrained environments.
By using `__slots__`, you can optimize memory usage and improve the performance of your Python applications.
