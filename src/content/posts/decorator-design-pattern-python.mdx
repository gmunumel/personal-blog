# Decorator Design Pattern in Python

In this article, we explore the decorator design pattern in Python, a versatile and powerful
technique for dynamically modifying the behavior of functions or methods without altering their source code.
Decorators are a core feature in Python and are frequently used for logging, access control, memoization,
performance measurement, and many other tasks.

We will first clarify the distinction between the general decorator design pattern and Pythonâ€™s built-in
decorator feature. Then, we will walk through how Python decorators implement the underlying
pattern using closures, the `nonlocal` keyword, and built-in tools like `functools.wraps` and `functools.cache`.
By the end, you will have both a conceptual understanding of the pattern and practical
examples you can apply directly to your own code.

## Decorator Design Pattern

The decorator pattern is a structural design pattern
that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects
from the same class. Python decorators, on the other hand, are a specific implementation of this pattern using functions.

The image illustrates the following facts:

- Each component can be used on its own or wrapped by a decorator.
- The `ConcreteComponent` is the object we are going to dynamically add new behavior to. It extends `Component`.
- Each decorator _HAS-A_ (wraps) a component. Meaning the decorator has an instance variable that holds a reference to a component.
- `Decorator`s implement the same interface or abstract class as the component they are going to decorate.
- The `ConcreteDecorator` inherits (from the `Decorator` class) an instance variable for the thing it decorates.
- `Decorator`s can add new methods.

Much of this complexity is needed for Object Oriented Programming languages because they do not have a
built-in way to modify behavior at runtime. Next, we will see how Python decorators implement the
decorator pattern using functions, which are first-class citizens in Python.

## Python Decorator

Since Python 2.4, decorators have been a part of the language, allowing you to wrap a function or method with another function. Python core
developers chose to reuse the term "decorator" for a completely unrelated feature they were adding to the language. Python decorators
can be easily implemented in a dynamic language like Python, where functions are [first-class citizens](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/first-class-functions-python/).

### Definition

A decorator is essentially a class that is an _adapter_ (see [Adapter Pattern](https://python-patterns.guide/gang-of-four/composition-over-inheritance/#solution-1-the-adapter-pattern)),
that implements the same interface as the object it wraps and delegates method calls to the wrapped object.
It can also add additional behavior before or after the method call.

Some examples of decorators include:

- **Logging**: Automatically log function calls and their arguments.
- **Access Control**: Check user permissions before allowing access to a function.
- **Memoization**: Cache the results of expensive function calls and return the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

Python decorators are typically defined using the `@decorator_name` syntax above a function definition,
which is syntactic sugar for passing the function to the decorator. In the example below, a decorator named `decorate`

```python
# no-run
@decorate
def my_function():
    print("Running my_function()")
```

has the same effect as:

```python
# no-run
def my_function():
    print("Running my_function()")

my_function = decorate(my_function)
```

The end result is the same: `my_function` is now wrapped by the `decorate` function.

A decorator usually replaces a function with a new function that adds some functionality before or after the original function call.

```python
def decorate(func):
    def inner():
        print("Running inner()")
    return inner

@decorate
def my_function():
    print("Running my_function()")

my_function()
print(my_function)
```

You would expect to see the output `Running my_function()`, but instead you see `Running inner()`. This is because the `my_function` has
been replaced by the `inner` function defined in the `decorate` function.

### Runtime Execution

A key aspect of decorators is that they are executed at runtime, meaning that the decorator function is called when the decorated function is defined,
not when it is called. This allows decorators to modify the behavior of functions dynamically.

```python
# decorator_example.py
list_decorators = []

def decorate(func):
    print(f"Running decorate({func})")
    list_decorators.append(func)
    return func

@decorate
def my_f1():
    print("Running my_f1()")

@decorate
def my_f2():
    print("Running my_f2()")

def my_f3():
    print("Running my_f3()")

def main():
    print("Running main()")
    print("list_decorators: ", list_decorators)
    my_f1()
    my_f2()
    my_f3()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Note that the `decorate` function is called when the `my_f1` and `my_f2` functions are defined, not when they are called. When
`decorate` is called, it prints the function being decorated and appends it to the `list_decorators`.

If the file is imported as a module and not as a script, the output will be:

```bash
>>> import decorator_example.py
Running decorate(<function my_f1 at 0x...>)
Running decorate(<function my_f2 at 0x...>)

>>> print(decorator_example.list_decorators)
[<function my_f1 at 0x...>, <function my_f2 at 0x...>]
```

See how the `decorate` function is called as soon as the module is imported, not when the functions are called.

### Closures

A closure is a function that retains the bindings of the _free variables_ that exist when the function is defined, so that they
can be used later when the function is invoked and the defining scope is no longer available.

Closures are often used in decorators to capture the state of variables at the time the decorator is applied. In the following example,
we create a decorator that captures a value in a closure:

```python
def decorator_with_closure():
    store = []
    def decorator(new_value):
        store.append(new_value)
        return store
    return decorator

values = decorator_with_closure()
print(values("a"))
print(values("b"))
```

The closure is the body of function `decorator_with_closure` (expect for the instruction `return decorator`), which captures the _free variable_ `store`.
When `values` is called with a new value, it appends the value to `store` and returns the updated list.

<figure className="flex flex-col items-center article-figure">
  ![Closure](/decorator-design-pattern-python/closure.png)
  <div>
    <figcaption className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-1 text-center">
      Closure
    </figcaption>
  </div>
</figure>

Internally, Python stores the closure in a `__closure__` attribute of the function object. Names of local
and free variables are stored in the `__code__` attribute.

```bash
>>> values.__closure__
(<cell at 0x...: list object at 0x...>,)
>>> values.__code__.co_varnames
(,)
>>> values.__code__.co_freevars
('store',)
```

In the next section we will see how to assign a value to a local variable in the closure.

### `nonlocal` Keyword

The `nonlocal` keyword is used in Python to declare that a variable refers to a variable in the nearest enclosing scope that is not global.
Using the example above, we can modify the `store` variable in the closure to allow it to be modified directly: `store += new_value`
instead of `store.append(new_value)`. This will raise an error if we try to modify `store` directly without declaring it as `nonlocal`.
Below you will see the example and the error raised.

```python
def decorator_with_closure():
    store = []
    def decorator(new_value):
        store += new_value
        return store
    return decorator

values = decorator_with_closure()
print(values("a"))
```

Python complains that it cannot access `store`. In this case, the instruction `store += new_value` is trying to do a `store = store + new_value`, which
is not allowed because `store` is a local variable in the closure. But why is this different from `store.append(new_value)`?
The reason is that with `append` we never assigned the `store` variable, we only called `store.append` and used it, we take advantage of mutability of
lists. Whereas with `+=` we are trying to reassign the `store` variable, which is not allowed because it is a local variable in the closure.

A solution is to declare `store` as `nonlocal`:

```python
def decorator_with_closure():
    store = []
    def decorator(new_value):
        nonlocal store
        store += new_value
        return store
    return decorator

values = decorator_with_closure()
print(values("a"))
```

### A Modern Example

The following is a modern example to calculate a factorial using a decorator, which is a common use case for decorators in Python.

```python
import time

def time_factorial(func):
    def wrapper(n):
        start = time.perf_counter()
        result = func(n)
        end = time.perf_counter()
        print(f"factorial({n}) took {end - start:.6f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@time_factorial
def factorial(n):
    """Calculate factorial recursively."""
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n-1)

print(factorial(5))
print(factorial(6))
print(f"Function name: {factorial.__name__}")
print(f"The docstring is: {factorial.__doc__}")
```

In this example, the `time_factorial` decorator measures the time taken to compute the factorial of a number.
The `factorial` function is decorated with `@time_factorial`, which means that when `factorial` is called,
it will first execute the `wrapper` function defined in `time_factorial`. Attribute `__name__`
will have the name of the wrapped function: `wrapper`, while attribute `__doc__` is `None` because there is no docstring
in the wrapped function `wrapper`. If the time measurement values
are not printed correctly most likely is a problem with [pyodide](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide) web
assembly implementation (for real timing measurements, use a native Python environment).

### `functools.wraps` Decorator

`functools` provides a `wraps` decorator that can be used to preserve the metadata of the original function
when it is wrapped by a decorator. This is useful for debugging and introspection, as it allows you to see
the original function's name, docstring, and other attributes.

The example above can be modified to use `functools.wraps` to preserve the metadata of the original function:

```python
import time
import functools

def time_factorial(func):
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(n):
        start = time.perf_counter()
        result = func(n)
        end = time.perf_counter()
        print(f"factorial({n}) took {end - start:.6f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@time_factorial
def factorial(n):
    """Calculate factorial recursively."""
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n-1)

print(factorial(5))
print(factorial(6))
print(f"Function name: {factorial.__name__}")
print(f"The docstring is: {factorial.__doc__}")
```

Thanks to the `wraps` decorator, the `__name__` attribute will match that of the
original function, and the `__doc__` attribute will also be preserved.

### `functools.cache` Decorator

_Memoization_ is an optimization technique that involves caching the results of expensive function
calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.
The `functools.cache` decorator in Python provides a simple way to apply memoization to a function.

Consider the following example of a slow recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number:

```python
import time
import functools

def time_fibonacci(func):
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(n):
        start = time.perf_counter()
        result = func(n)
        end = time.perf_counter()
        print(f"fibonacci({n}) took {end - start:.6f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@time_fibonacci
def slow_fibonacci(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return slow_fibonacci(n-2) + slow_fibonacci(n-1)

print(slow_fibonacci(6))
```

In this example, the call to `fibonacci(1)` occurs eight times, `fibonacci(2)` is five times, etc. We can
optimize this by using the `functools.cache` decorator to cache the results of the `slow_fibonacci` function.

```python
import time
import functools

def time_fibonacci(func):
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(n):
        start = time.perf_counter()
        result = func(n)
        end = time.perf_counter()
        print(f"factorial({n}) took {end - start:.6f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@functools.cache
@time_fibonacci
def fibonacci(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-2) + fibonacci(n-1)

print(fibonacci(6))
```

As you can see there is a significant improvement in performance when using caching, no additionally calls are
made when the same parameter is used again.

### Monkey Patching

Monkey patching is a technique to modify or extend the behavior of libraries or modules at runtime. This can
be useful for testing, debugging, or adding new functionality to existing code without modifying the
original source.

Here's a simple example of monkey patching in Python:

```python
class Dog:
    def bark(self):
        return "Woof!"

def new_bark(self):
    return "Meow!"

# Apply monkey patch
Dog.bark = new_bark

dog = Dog()
print(dog.bark())
```

In this example, we define a `Dog` class with a `bark` method. We then create a
new function `new_bark` and replace the original `bark` method with the new one. As a result, when we call `dog.bark()`, it now returns "Meow!" instead of "Woof!".

There are some caveats to be aware of when using monkey patching. Since it modifies the original
class or module at runtime, it can lead to unexpected behavior, especially if other parts of the
code rely on the original implementation. Additionally, monkey patches are not always easy to track
down, making debugging more challenging.

# Conclusion

We have seen how the decorator design pattern provides a clean, flexible way to extend or modify
the behavior of functions and methods in Python without touching their original implementation.
By combining the principles of the classic pattern with Pythonâ€™s native decorator syntax, you
can create solutions that are both elegant and reusable.

From measuring execution time, to caching expensive results, to dynamically altering class methods,
decorators open the door to powerful runtime modifications. As with monkey patching and other
dynamic techniques, they should be used thoughtfully, but when applied well, decorators
can greatly improve code organization, readability, and maintainability.
