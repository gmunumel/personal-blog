# Redux Toolkit vs Zustand - A Comparative Guide

In this article, we will explore and compare two popular state management libraries for React applications: Redux Toolkit and Zustand.
Both libraries offer unique features and benefits, making them suitable for different use cases. By the end of this guide, you will have a
clearer understanding of which library might be the best fit for your project.

## State Management in React

React applications often require a way to manage and share state between components. Techniques such as
[prop-drilling](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component) and the [Context API](https://react.dev/reference/react/createContext)
can be used for simple state management, but as applications grow in complexity, they may require more robust solutions.

Some of the drawbacks of using prop-drilling and Context API for state management include:

- **Prop-drilling**: Passing props through multiple layers of components can lead to cumbersome and hard-to-maintain code.
- **Context API**: While it helps avoid prop-drilling, it can lead to performance issues due to unnecessary re-renders of
  components that consume the context.

### Prop-drilling Example

The following example illustrates how a deeply nested component must receive props passed through multiple levels:

```javascript
() => {
  function Child({ message }) {
    return <p>Child says: {message}</p>;
  }

  function Middle({ message }) {
    return <Child message={message} />;
  }

  function Parent() {
    return <Middle message="Hello via props!" />;
  }

  return <Parent />;
};
```

Here `Parent → Middle → Child` must all pass `message`, even though only `Child` needs it.

### Context API Example

Here we avoid prop drilling by using `React.createContext`:

```javascript
() => {
  const MessageContext = React.createContext("default");

  function Child() {
    const message = React.useContext(MessageContext);
    return <p>Child says: {message}</p>;
  }

  function Parent() {
    return (
      <MessageContext.Provider value="Hello via Context!">
        <Child />
      </MessageContext.Provider>
    );
  }

  return <Parent />;
};
```

Now only `Parent` provides the value, and `Child` can consume it directly without going through `Middle`. However, if `MessageContext` changes,
all components consuming it will re-render, which can lead to performance issues in larger applications.

To address these challenges, developers often turn to state management libraries like Redux Toolkit and Zustand.

## Redux Toolkit

Redux Toolkit is the official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development. It simplifies the process of
setting up and managing state in React applications.

The following example demonstrates a simple counter application using Redux Toolkit. The initial setup involves creating a slice of state
with actions to increment and decrement the counter.

```bash
// Redux setup
const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: "counter",
  initialState: { value: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      state.value += 1;
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.value -= 1;
    },
  },
});

const store = configureStore({ reducer: { counter: counterSlice.reducer } });
const { increment, decrement } = counterSlice.actions;
```

The component below demonstrates how to use Redux Toolkit to display and update the counter value.

```javascript
() => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const count = useSelector((state) => state.counter.value);
  return (
    <div>
      <button
        className="rounded cursor-pointer border px-2"
        onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}
      >
        -
      </button>
      <span className="px-3">{count}</span>
      <button
        className="rounded cursor-pointer border px-2"
        onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}
      >
        +
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Zustand

Zustand is a small, fast, and scalable state management library that uses hooks for state management in React applications. It provides a
simple and intuitive API, making it easy to create and manage state without the boilerplate code often associated with Redux. Zustand
means "state" in German.

Following is a simple example of using Zustand for state management. The initial setup creates a store with a `bears`
state and an `increase` action to increment the count.

```bash
// Zustand setup
const useBearStore = create((set) => ({
    bears: 0,
    increase: () => set((state: any) => ({ bears: state.bears + 1 })),
}));
```

The component below demonstrates how to use the Zustand store to display and update the number of bears.

```javascript
() => {
  const bears = useBearStore((state) => state.bears);
  const increase = useBearStore((state) => state.increase);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Bears: {bears}</p>
      <button className="rounded cursor-pointer border px-2" onClick={increase}>
        Add bear
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

# Conclusion

Both Redux Toolkit and Zustand are powerful state management libraries for React applications, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

Redux Toolkit is well-suited for larger applications with complex state management needs, offering a rich ecosystem and excellent TypeScript support. However, it comes with more boilerplate and a steeper learning curve.

On the other hand, Zustand provides a simpler and more intuitive API, making it easier to learn and use. It is a great choice for smaller applications or when you need a lightweight state management solution. However, it may lack some of the advanced features and ecosystem support that Redux Toolkit offers.

Ultimately, the choice between Redux Toolkit and Zustand depends on your specific use case, team familiarity, and project requirements.
