# Singleton Design Pattern in Python

Usually we want to create multiple instances of a class, but sometimes we need to ensure
that only one instance of a class exists throughout the application. This is where the Singleton
Design Pattern comes into play. Common examples are database connections, logging, cache
management or configuration settings.

## Singleton Design Pattern

Restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance.

### First implementation

In Python, the **Singleton design pattern** can be implemented using a class variable to
keep track of the instance. When a new instance is requested, it checks if an instance already exists.
If it does, it returns the existing instance; otherwise, it creates a new one.

```python
class Singleton:
  _instance = None

  def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
    if not cls._instance:
      cls._instance = super(Singleton, cls).__new__(cls)
    return cls._instance


singleton1 = Singleton()
singleton2 = Singleton()
print(singleton1 is singleton2)
```

The `__new__` (dunder `new`) method is overridden to control instance creation. The class
variable `_instance` is used to store the single instance of the class. When a new
instance is requested, it checks if `_instance` is `None`. If it is, it creates a new
instance using `super()`. If an instance already exists,
it simply returns that instance.

While this implementation works, it has some limitations. For example, it does not handle
thread safety, which can lead to issues in multi-threaded applications. Additionally, it does
not allow for lazy initialization, meaning the instance is created as soon as
the class is defined, even if it is never used.

### Second implementation

A more robust implementation can be achieved using a decorator to ensure thread
safety and lazy initialization.

```python
import threading

class SingletonMeta(type):
  _instances = {}
  _lock = threading.Lock()

  def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
    if cls not in cls._instances:
      with cls._lock:
        if cls not in cls._instances:
          cls._instances[cls] = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
    return cls._instances[cls]

class Singleton(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
  def __init__(self):
    print("Initializing singleton instance")

singleton1 = Singleton()
singleton2 = Singleton()
print(singleton1 is singleton2)
```

In this implementation, we define a metaclass `SingletonMeta` that overrides the `__call__` method.
This method creates instances of the class. It uses a class variable `_instances`
to store instances of the classes that use this metaclass. The `_lock` variable is a threading lock
that ensures that only one thread can create an instance at a time.

### A Pythonic way

While the two examples above demonstrate the **Singleton design pattern**, Python provides a more
Pythonic way to implement it using a module. In Python, modules are singletons by nature, meaning
that when a module is imported, it is only loaded once, and subsequent imports return the same instance.
This takes advantage of Python's module system and global definition to create a singleton-like behavior.
See question ["How do I share global variables across modules?"](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#how-do-i-share-global-variables-across-modules).

```python 
# no-run
# singleton.py
class Singleton:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 42

    def print_value(self):
        print(f"The value is: {self.value}")


single_instance = Singleton()


# main.py
from singleton import single_instance

single_instance.print_value()

single_instance.value = 100

from singleton import single_instance as another_instance

assert another_instance.print_value() == single_instance.print_value()
print(f"Are instances the same?: {another_instance is single_instance}")
```

In this example, the `Singleton` class is defined in a separate module (`singleton.py`),
and an instance of it is created as `single_instance`. When this module is imported in
`main.py`, the same instance is used, ensuring that there is only one instance of
the `Singleton` class throughout the application.

## Conclusion

The Singleton Design Pattern is a useful design pattern in Python when you need to ensure that
only one instance of a class exists in your application. While the first implementation
is simple and straightforward; it has limitations in terms of thread safety and lazy initialization.
The second implementation using a metaclass provides a more robust solution, ensuring thread safety
and lazy initialization. However, Python's module system provides a more Pythonic way to achieve
singleton behavior, leveraging the fact that modules are, by nature, singletons. This approach is
cleaner and more idiomatic, making it the preferred way to implement singletons in Python.
