# Clean Architecture in Python - Part 1

Clean Architecture is a software design pattern that emphasizes the separation of concerns, making the
codebase more maintainable, testable, and adaptable to change. It is often referred to as Hexagonal
Architecture or Ports and Adapters. This architecture allows developers to create systems that are
independent of frameworks, databases, and external libraries.

Python's dynamic nature and flexibility make it an excellent language for applying Clean Architecture
principles. However, Clean Architecture is not the first choice for many Python developers, who often
favor simpler, more pragmatic approaches. Correctly applying Clean Architecture in Python can lead to
challenges, especially for those new to the concept.

This article introduces the core concepts and principles of Clean Architecture as applied to Python
development. It explores the motivations for adopting Clean Architecture over traditional layered
approaches, clarifies related architectural patterns such as Hexagonal and Onion Architecture,
and demonstrates how to map these ideas to Python’s features and idioms. Through practical examples,
the article covers organizing code into layers, defining interfaces and entities, implementing
use cases, and achieving dependency inversion. By the end, readers will understand how Clean
Architecture promotes maintainability, testability, and flexibility in Python applications,
setting the stage for hands-on implementation in the next part of the series.

In [part 2](/posts/clean-architecture-python-part-2), a simple Python application will be developed to
demonstrate a practical example.

## Why not use Layers?

Layers are a common architectural pattern that has been used in software development for decades.
Especially for web applications, layers are often used to separate concerns such as presentation,
business logic, and data access.

```

They provide a way to organize code into distinct layers, each with its own responsibility. However,
there are several downsides to using layers:

- **Promote Database-Driven Design**: Layers often lead to a design that is tightly coupled to
  the database, making it difficult to change the underlying data store without affecting the
  entire application.
- **Prone to Shortcuts**: Developers may take shortcuts by placing business logic in the
  presentation layer or data access layer, leading to a violation of the separation of concerns.
- **Hide Use Cases**: Layers can obscure the use cases of the application, making it difficult to
  understand the system's behavior and requirements.
- **Difficult Collaboration**: When multiple developers work on different layers, it can lead to
  conflicts and difficulties in merging changes, especially if the layers are tightly coupled.
- **Testing Challenges**: Testing individual layers can be difficult when the layers are tightly coupled.

Clean Architecture addresses these issues by promoting a more flexible and modular approach.

But before we dive into Clean Architecture, let's clarify some terminology and concepts that are
essential for understanding this architectural style.

## Multiple Names for the Same Concept

Clean Architecture is often referred to by different names, including Hexagonal Architecture,
Ports and Adapters, and Onion Architecture. While these names may suggest different approaches,
they all share the same core principles of separation of concerns and dependency inversion.

### Clean Architecture

Clean Architecture, as coined by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) in his book
[Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-architecture-a/9780134494272/),
emphasizes the separation of concerns
and the independence of the business logic from external frameworks and technologies. It promotes a
design that is easy to understand, maintain, and test, while allowing for flexibility in the choice of
technologies used in the application.

<figure className="flex flex-col items-center article-figure">
  ![Diagram Clean
  Architecture](/clean-architecture-python-part-1/clean_architecture.png)
  <div>
    <figcaption className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-1 text-center">
      Diagram Clean Architecture
    </figcaption>
  </div>
</figure>

The layers in this architecture are wrapped around each other in concentric circles. The main rule is that
source code dependencies must point inward, toward the higher-level policies and the **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**.
The innermost circle contains the core business logic (domain services, use cases, and entities), while the outer circles contain interfaces, use cases,
and external dependencies.

Because the inner circles are independent of the outer circles, the core business logic can be implemented
without any knowledge of the external systems, allowing us to use **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** approach
if desired.

### Hexagonal Architecture

Hexagonal Architecture, also known as **Ports and Adapters**, was introduced by Alistair Cockburn
in his [article](https://alistair.cockburn.us/hexagonal-architecture). It emphasizes the
separation of the application's core logic from its external dependencies, such as databases, user interfaces,
and external services. The core logic is surrounded by ports (interfaces) that define how the application
interacts with the outside world, while adapters implement these ports to connect to external systems.

<figure className="flex flex-col items-center article-figure">
  ![Diagram Hexagonal
  Architecture](/clean-architecture-python-part-1/hexagonal_architecture.png)
  <div>
    <figcaption className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-1 text-center">
      Diagram Hexagonal Architecture
    </figcaption>
  </div>
</figure>

The application code is represented as a hexagon, with the core business logic at the center. Notice that
the hexagon has no dependencies on the outside world, meaning that the core logic is independent of
any specific technology or framework, validating the _DIP_.

Outside the hexagon, we have various **adapters** that implement the ports, allowing the application to
interact with different external systems. There might be a web adapter that interacts with a web browser,
some adapters interacting with a database, and others that connect to external services or APIs.

To allow communication between the application core and the adapters, we define
**ports** which are interfaces the core logic expects external systems to implement. You could have two types of ports:

- **Inbound Ports**: These are interfaces that the application core exposes to the outside world.
  They define how external systems can interact with the core logic.
- **Outbound Ports**: These are interfaces that the application core uses to interact with external systems.

Port and adapter terminology is often used interchangeably with the term **interface**. To clarify:

- **Ports**: Are the interfaces that define the expected interactions between the application core and external systems.
- **Adapters**: Are the implementations of these ports, allowing the application to communicate with various external systems.

We could also define _DDD_ bounded contexts within the hexagonal architecture,
where business logic is implemented in the use case classes and entities. The use case classes are
**domain services**, each implementing a single use case. If increasing use cases becomes a problem you can create an
**application service** that coordinates multiple use cases and their interactions.

### Onion Architecture

Onion Architecture, introduced by Jeffrey Palermo in his [blog post](https://jeffreypalermo.com/2008/07/the-onion-architecture-part-1/),
is similar to Clean Architecture but emphasizes the dependency inversion principle by organizing the
application into concentric circles. The innermost circle contains the domain model (entities), while
the outer circles contain interfaces, tests, and external dependencies. This structure promotes a clear separation of concerns
and promotes testability by isolating the core logic from external dependencies.

<figure className="flex flex-col items-center article-figure">
  ![Diagram Onion
  Architecture](/clean-architecture-python-part-1/onion_architecture.png)
  <div>
    <figcaption className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-1 text-center">
      Diagram Onion Architecture
    </figcaption>
  </div>
</figure>

There is an important distinction: **Application Core**. This service is responsible for
coordinating the interactions between the Domain Model, Domain Services, and Application Services.

In this article, I primarily focus on Clean Architecture, but the principles discussed can be applied
to Hexagonal Architecture and Onion Architecture as well. The key takeaway is that all these architectures
share the same core principles of separation of concerns, dependency inversion, and independence from frameworks.

Now let's explore the core principles of Clean Architecture and how they can be applied in Python.

## Core Principles of Clean Architecture

### Separation of Concerns

Each layer of the architecture should have a distinct responsibility, making the system easier to understand
and maintain. This separation allows developers to focus on specific aspects of the system without being
overwhelmed by the entire codebase.

This principle is often implemented by organizing the code into different modules or packages,
each representing a specific layer of the architecture. For example, you might have separate modules for
entities, use cases, interface adapters, and frameworks/drivers. This modularity promotes a clear separation
of concerns and makes it easier to navigate the codebase.

### Dependency Inversion

In a layered architecture (shown <a href="#why-not-use-layers">before</a>), the cross-layer dependencies
always point down to the next layer. When the [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle)
is applied, the upper layers have more reasons to change than the lower layers. Indeed, any change in the
**Persistence** layer (e.g., changing the database) would require changes in the **Domain** layer, and also in
**Web** layer. But the **Domain** layer should be independent of the **Persistence** layer because it contains
the core business logic, should only change when the business requirements change.

How to solve this? By applying the _DIP_, which states that:

> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

This means that the higher-level modules (e.g., use cases, entities) should not depend directly on lower-level
modules (e.g., database, web framework). Instead, both should depend on abstractions (interfaces) that
define the interactions between them. This allows for a more flexible and modular design, where changes
in lower-level modules do not affect higher-level modules, and vice versa.

This is a key aspect for all the architectures mentioned above.

Following is an example of the **Domain Layered Architecture** without and with Dependency Inversion:

<figure className="flex flex-col items-center article-figure">
  ![Comparison Domain Layered Architecture without and with Dependency
  Inversion](/clean-architecture-python-part-1/dependency_inversion.png)
  <div>
    <figcaption className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-1 text-center">
      Comparison the Domain Layered Architecture without and with Dependency
      Inversion
    </figcaption>
  </div>
</figure>

On the left side, there is a service in the domain layer that works with entities and repositories from the persistence layer. The problem
with this design is that the domain layer is tightly coupled to the persistence layer, forcing it to change when the persistence layer changes.
The domain services have to deal not only with the domain logic but also with the persistence logic, which violates the
_SRP_.

To get the result on the right side, first, entities were pulled up into the domain layer as they represent domain objects independent
of the persistence layer. Then, notice that there is a circular dependency between both layers because the repository from the persistence layer depends on the
entity, which is now in the domain layer. To solve this, DIP is applied creating an interface for the repository in the domain
layer (`<<interface>> Repository`), and let the actual repository in the persistence layer implement it (`RepositoryImpl`).

In summary, _DIP_ enables:

> Turn around (invert) the direction of any dependency within your codebase.

But only if you have control over the two ends of the dependency.
If you have a dependency on a third-party library or framework, you may not be able to apply DIP directly.

### Independence from Frameworks

This principle promotes the idea that the core business logic should be independent of any
frameworks or libraries, making it easier to switch to a different framework or technology stack
without affecting the core logic of the application. This independence allows developers to focus on
the business logic without being constrained by the limitations or requirements of a specific framework.

### Testability

This principle is closely related to the separation of concerns and dependency inversion principles.
By organizing the code into distinct layers and using interfaces to define interactions between them,
developers can easily write unit tests for each layer without worrying about the dependencies on other layers.
It also facilitates integration testing by allowing the use of mock implementations for external dependencies.

## Mapping Clean Architecture to Python

In Python, we can map the principles of Clean Architecture to the language's features and idioms. This includes using:

- **Modules and Packages**: Organize code into modules and packages to reflect the different layers of the architecture.

  ```python
  # no-run
  # src/app.py
  from domain import User
  from infrastructure import UserRepository

  user_repo = UserRepository()
  user = User("John Doe", "john@example.com")
  user_repo.save(user)
  ```

  In this example, the `domain` package contains the core business logic, while the `infrastructure`
  package contains the implementation of the repository that interacts with the database. This separation allows for
  a clear distinction between the core logic and the external dependencies, promoting the principles of Clean Architecture.

- **Interfaces**: Use abstract base classes to define contracts between components, allowing for flexibility and testability.

  ```python
  # no-run
  # src/adapter/outbound/persistence/user_repository.py
  from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

  class UserRepository(ABC):
      @abstractmethod
      def save(self, user):
          pass

      @abstractmethod
      def find_by_email(self, email):
          pass
  ```

  In this example, the `UserRepository` is an abstract base class that defines the contract for a user repository.

- **Data Classes**: Use data classes to represent entities, making it easier to define and manage the core business logic.

  ```python
  # no-run
  # src/application/domain/model/user.py
  from dataclasses import dataclass

  @dataclass
  class User:
      name: str
      email: str

      def __post_init__(self):
          if not self.email:
              raise ValueError("Email cannot be empty")
  ```

  In this example, the `User` class is a data class that represents an user entity. The `__post_init__` method is used to
  validate the email field, ensuring that it is not empty. This approach allows for a clean and concise definition of entities while
  still providing validation logic.

- **Dependency Injection**: Use dependency injection to manage dependencies between components, making it easier to swap implementations and write tests.

  ```python
  # no-run
  # src/application/domain/service/user_service.py
  from domain import User, UserRepository

  class UserService:
      def __init__(self, user_repository: UserRepository):
          self.user_repository = user_repository

      def register_user(self, name: str, email: str):
          user = User(name, email)
          self.user_repository.save(user)
  ```

  In this example, the `UserService` class depends on the `UserRepository` interface, allowing for different implementations
  of the repository to be injected at runtime. This promotes loose coupling and makes it easier to test the `UserService` class by providing
  a mock implementation of the `UserRepository`.

## Entities: The Core Business Logic

Entities are the core business logic of the application. They represent the fundamental concepts and rules of the domain.
Entities should encapsulate domain rules and remain agnostic of infrastructure or frameworks, and should encapsulate the business rules and logic.

**Core business logic** refers to the central components of an application, including domain services, use cases, and entities,
which collectively model and execute the essential business rules.

```python
# no-run
# src/application/domain/model/user.py
from dataclasses import dataclass
from src.application.domain.model.email import Email

@dataclass
class User:
    name: str
    email: Email

    def __post_init__(self):
        if not self.email:
            raise ValueError("Email cannot be empty")

    def change_email(self, new_email: str):
        if not new_email:
            raise ValueError("New email cannot be empty")
        self.email = new_email
```

In this example, the `User` class is an entity that represents a user in the system. It has a name and an email address.

### Value Objects

Alongside entities, we can also define **value objects** that represent immutable values in the domain.

```python
# no-run
# src/application/domain/model/email.py
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Email:
    value: str

    def __post_init__(self):
        if not self.value or "@" not in self.value:
            raise ValueError("Invalid email address")

    def __str__(self):
        return self.value
```

In this case, the `Email` class is a value object that represents an email address.
Value objects are typically immutable and should not have any behavior that modifies their state. To indicate to Python that they are immutable,
we use the `frozen=True` parameter in the `dataclass` decorator.

## Use Cases: Application Business Rules

Use cases represent the application business rules and define how the entities interact with each other to achieve specific goals.

```python
# no-run
# src/application/use_cases/register_user.py
from src.application.domain.model.user import User
from src.application.domain.model.email import Email
from src.application.domain.service.user_service import UserService

class RegisterUser:
    def __init__(self, user_service: UserService):
        self.user_service = user_service

    def execute(self, name: str, email: str):
        user = User(name=name, email=Email(email))
        self.user_service.register_user(user)
```

Use cases should be designed to be independent of any external dependencies, such as databases or frameworks.
They should encapsulate the application business rules and logic, making them easy to test and maintain.

## Interface Adapters

Interface adapters are responsible for converting data between the format used by the application and the
format used by external systems, such as databases, web frameworks, or APIs. They implement the ports defined
in the core business logic and allow the application to interact with external systems without being tightly coupled to them.

The following is an example of an interface adapter port for `RegisterUser`,

```python
# no-run
# src/application/port/outbound/register_user_port.py
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from src.application.domain.model.user import User
from src.application.domain.model.user_id import UserId
from src.application.domain.model.name import Name

class RegisterUserPort(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def register_user(self, user_id: UserId, user_name: Name) -> User:
        pass
```

This abstract base class defines the contract for a user repository, which can be implemented by different adapters to
interact with various data stores.

## Frameworks and Drivers

Frameworks and drivers are the outermost layer of the architecture and are responsible for interacting with external systems,
such as web frameworks, databases, or message queues. They provide concrete implementations of the ports defined by interface adapters
and provide the necessary infrastructure to run the application.

```python
# no-run
# src/app.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from src.application.use_cases.register_user import RegisterUser

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/register")
async def register_user(request: Request):
    data = await request.json()
    name = data.get("name")
    email = data.get("email")

    if not name or not email:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Name and email are required")

    user_service = UserService()
    use_case = RegisterUser(user_service)
    use_case.execute(name, email)

    return JSONResponse(content={"message": "User registered successfully"}, status_code=201)
```

This example shows a simple [FastApi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) web controller that handles user registration.
It receives user data from the request, validates it, and then calls the `RegisterUser` use case to
register the user. The `UserService` should be injected into the controller, allowing for different implementations
of the service to be used, such as a mock service for testing or a real service that interacts with a database.

## Dependency Inversion in Python

Dependency inversion is a key principle of Clean Architecture that allows for flexibility and modularity in the design.
In Python, we can achieve dependency inversion using `abc.ABC` + `@abstractmethod`, `typing.Protocol`, **Duck Typing**, or
Dependency Injector Frameworks to define the contracts for different components.

### Using `abc.ABC` + `@abstractmethod`

```python
# no-run
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class AdminServicePort(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def register_admin(self, name: str, email: str):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def get_admin(self, admin_id: str):
        pass
```

One key benefit of `ABC` and `@abstractmethod`
is that it provides a clear contract for the service, making it easier to understand and implement.
However, it requires the implementing class to inherit from the abstract base class, which can
make it less flexible if you want to use multiple inheritance or mixins.

### Using `typing.Protocol`

You can also use `typing.Protocol` ([PEP 544](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Protocol))
to define a protocol that specifies the expected methods and properties of an object.

```python
# no-run
from typing import Protocol

class AdminServicePort(Protocol):
    def register_admin(self, name: str, email: str):
        pass

    def get_admin(self, admin_id: str):
        pass
```

An advantage of using `Protocol` is that it allows for more flexible and dynamic code,
as it does not require the implementing class to inherit from a specific base class.
However, it does not provide the same level of type checking as `ABC` and `@abstractmethod`,
which can lead to runtime errors if the implementing class does not implement the expected methods.

### Using _Duck Typing_

Duck typing is a concept in Python that allows for more flexible and dynamic code.
Instead of relying on explicit interfaces or protocols, duck typing focuses on whether an
object behaves like the expected type.

> If an object implements the required methods and behaves like the expected type,
> it can be used interchangeably—even without explicit inheritance or interface implementation.

In the context of Clean Architecture, this means that
as long as an object implements the required methods and properties,
it can be used interchangeably with other objects of the same "type".

```python
# no-run
class AdminService:
    def __init__(self, port):
        self.port = port

    def do_something(self):
        self.port.register_admin("Alice", "alice@example.com")
```

Just require that the injected object has the needed methods. However, this approach can lead to
runtime errors if the object does not implement the expected methods.

### Dependency Injection Frameworks

Dependency injection frameworks, such as [Dependency Injector](https://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org/),
allow for more advanced dependency management and inversion in Python applications.

```python
# no-run
from dependency_injector import containers, providers

class AdminServicePort(Protocol):
    def register_admin(self, name: str, email: str):
        pass

    def get_admin(self, admin_id: str):
        pass

class AdminService:
    def __init__(self, port: AdminServicePort):
        self.port = port

    def register_admin(self, name: str, email: str):
        self.port.register_admin(name, email)
```

An advantage of using a dependency injection framework is that it provides a
more structured and organized way to manage dependencies,
allowing for better separation of concerns and easier testing. However, it can add complexity to the codebase
and may require additional configuration and setup.

## Common Pitfalls and Tips

When applying Clean Architecture in Python, there are some common pitfalls to avoid:

- **Overcomplicating the Design**: Clean Architecture can lead to over-engineering if not applied judiciously.
  Start with a simple design and gradually refactor as needed.
- **Ignoring Python Idioms**: Python has its own idioms and conventions that may not align with the strict
  principles of Clean Architecture. Embrace Python's dynamic nature and flexibility while adhering to the core principles.
- **Neglecting Testing**: While Clean Architecture promotes testability, it requires discipline to write tests for each layer.
  Ensure that you have a solid testing strategy in place to validate the behavior of your application.
- **Tight Coupling**: Avoid tight coupling between layers by using interfaces and dependency injection.
- **Ignoring Performance**: While Clean Architecture promotes maintainability and testability, it can introduce
  performance overhead due to the additional layers and abstractions. Be mindful of performance implications
  and optimize where necessary, especially in performance-critical parts of the application.
- **Neglecting Domain-Driven Design**: Clean Architecture is often used in conjunction with DDD. If your application
  has complex business logic, consider applying DDD principles to model the domain effectively.
  This includes defining bounded contexts, aggregates, and domain events to capture the business rules and interactions.
- **Not Considering Scalability**: Clean Architecture is designed to be scalable, but it's essential to consider
  scalability from the beginning. Design the architecture to accommodate future growth and changes in requirements.
  This includes considering how to handle large volumes of data, high concurrency, and distributed systems.
- **Continuous Refactoring**: Clean Architecture is not a one-time effort. It requires continuous iteration and improvement
  as the application evolves. Regularly review and refactor the architecture to ensure that it remains aligned with
  the principles of Clean Architecture and meets the changing needs of the application.

Tips for successfully applying Clean Architecture in Python:

- **Start Small**: Begin with a small project or a specific module to apply Clean Architecture principles.
  Gradually expand the architecture as you gain experience and confidence.
- **Use Python's Features**: Leverage Python's dynamic nature, duck typing, and powerful libraries to implement
  Clean Architecture effectively. Use features like decorators, context managers, and data classes to simplify the design.
- **Use Design Patterns**: Apply design patterns where appropriate to solve common problems and improve the structure of the code.
- **Stay Pragmatic**: While Clean Architecture provides a solid foundation, it's essential to remain pragmatic and
  adapt the principles to fit the specific needs of your application. Avoid dogmatic adherence to the principles at the
  expense of practicality and simplicity.

# Conclusion

Clean Architecture is a powerful architectural pattern that promotes separation of concerns, dependency inversion,
and independence from frameworks. By applying these principles in Python, developers can create maintainable,
testable, and adaptable systems that are easy to understand and evolve over time.

In this article, we explored the key concepts of Clean Architecture in Python, including its core principles, how to map it
to Python's features, and practical examples of how to implement it in a Python application. It is the first part
of a series on Clean Architecture in Python. In the
[next part](/posts/clean-architecture-python-part-2), we will develop a simple Python application to
demonstrate a practical example of Clean Architecture.
