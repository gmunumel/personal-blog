# Strategy Design Pattern in Python

The **Strategy design pattern** tries to solve a situation when you have multiple possible algorithms and the
client is tightly coupled. Most probably your implementation generates multiple `if-else` statement to decide which
algorithm to use at runtime. This code is difficult to maintain, scale and is not aligned with [open-closed principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle)
(open for extension and close for modification).

## Strategy Design Pattern

Encapsulate each algorithm, make them interchangeable. Algorithms vary independently from clients.

The solution presented takes advantage of the fact that Python's functions are [first class objects](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/first-class-functions-python/).

### Case Study

Suppose you have an incredible story to tell and want to share it with your friends, so you decide to post it on your social media. You can make a post to `Instagram`, `Facebook` or `Twitter`.

The following code represents a class `SocialMedia` that is responsible for posting comments
to different social media platforms like `Instagram`, `Facebook`, and `Twitter`. The problem with
this code is that it uses a lot of `if-else` statements to determine which social media platform to use,
breaking the principle of [one reason to change (S of _SOLID_)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle).

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class SocialMedia:
    username: str
    social_media_type: str

    def post(self, content: str) -> None:
        if self.social_media_type == "Instagram":
            self.instagram_story(content)
        elif self.social_media_type == "Facebook":
            self.facebook_story(content)
        elif self.social_media_type == "Twitter":
            self.twitter_story(content)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported social media type")

    def set_social_media_type(self, social_media_type: str) -> None:
        self.social_media_type = social_media_type

    def instagram_story(self, content: str) -> None:
        print(f"Posting to Instagram: {content}, by {self.username}")

    def facebook_story(self, content: str) -> None:
        print(f"Posting to Facebook: {content}, by {self.username}")

    def twitter_story(self, content: str) -> None:
        print(f"Posting to Twitter: {content}, by {self.username}")


social_media = SocialMedia("John", "Instagram")
social_media.post("Hello, Instagram!")
social_media.set_social_media_type("Facebook")
social_media.post("Hello, Facebook!")
social_media.set_social_media_type("Twitter")
social_media.post("Hello, Twitter!")
```

### Code to an Interface

To improve the design, we can create an interface `Story` that defines a method `post`.
Each social media platform will implement this interface, allowing us to encapsulate the posting logic for each platform. The UML class diagram below illustrate that.

- **Context**: Provide a computation interchangeable component, in this case `SocialMedia`.
- **Strategy**: The common interface that implement the different algorithms: `Story`.
- **Concrete strategy**: One of the concrete subclasses of Strategy: `InstagramStory`, `FacebookStory` and `TwitterStory`.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Story(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def post(self, content: str, username: str) -> None:
        pass

class InstagramStory(Story):
    def post(self, content: str, username: str) -> None:
        print(f"Posting to Instagram: {content}, by {username}")

class FacebookStory(Story):
    def post(self, content: str, username: str) -> None:
        print(f"Posting to Facebook: {content}, by {username}")

class TwitterStory(Story):
    def post(self, content: str, username: str) -> None:
        print(f"Posting to Twitter: {content}, by {username}")


@dataclass
class SocialMedia:
    username: str
    social_media_type: Story

    def post(self, content: str) -> None:
        self.social_media_type.post(content, self.username)

    def set_social_media_type(self, social_media_type: Story) -> None:
        self.social_media_type = social_media_type


social_media = SocialMedia("John", InstagramStory())
social_media.post("Hello, Instagram!")
social_media.set_social_media_type(FacebookStory())
social_media.post("Hello, Facebook!")
social_media.set_social_media_type(TwitterStory())
social_media.post("Hello, Twitter!")
```

This approach allows us to easily add new social media platforms without modifying the existing code,
adhering to the open-closed principle. Each platform's posting logic is encapsulated in its own class,
making the code more maintainable and scalable. Interface classes in Python are defined using the `abc`
module, which provides the `ABC` class and the `abstractmethod` decorator to create abstract base classes.
However, in Python we don't have a strict interface like in other languages, so we can use duck typing.

### Move Algorithms to a Separate Module

To further improve the design, we can move the concrete strategy classes to a separate module.
This will help keep our code organized and maintainable, especially as we add more social media platforms in the future.

```python
# no-run
# interface_social_media.py
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Story(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def post(self, content: str, username: str) -> None:
        pass

class InstagramStory(Story):
    def post(self, content: str, username: str) -> None:
        print(f"Posting to Instagram: {content}, by {username}")

class FacebookStory(Story):
    def post(self, content: str, username: str) -> None:
        print(f"Posting to Facebook: {content}, by {username}")

class TwitterStory(Story):
    def post(self, content: str, username: str) -> None:
        print(f"Posting to Twitter: {content}, by {username}")


social_media_list = [InstagramStory(), FacebookStory(), TwitterStory()]


# social_media.py
from interface_social_media import social_media_list

def print_all_stories(username: str) -> None:
    for social_media_item in social_media_list:
        social_media_item.post("Hello, World!", username)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print_all_stories("John")
```

This modular approach allows us to easily add new social media platforms by simply
creating a new class that implements the `Story` interface and adding it to
the `social_media_list`.

### Decorator-Enhanced Strategy pattern

We could also enhance the Strategy design pattern by using a decorator to register story functions.
Store in `stories` a list of story functions that can be used to post content to different social media platforms.
The order of definition for `Story`, `stories`, and the function `story` is important to ensure that each
algorithm is registered correctly and can be called later, see the snippet below. This process is done by Python in import time
(before the application run), later when the application is executed, the `story` decorator will run
each function annotated with the decorator.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Optional, Callable

Story = Callable[["SocialMedia"], str]

stories: list[Story] = []

def story(story_func: Story) -> Story:
    stories.append(story_func)
    return story_func

@story
def instagram_story(social_media: "SocialMedia") -> str:
    content = "Hello, Instagram!"
    post = f"Posting to Instagram: {content}, by {social_media.username}"
    return post

@story
def facebook_story(social_media: "SocialMedia") -> str:
    content = "Hello, Facebook!"
    post = f"Posting to Facebook: {content}, by {social_media.username}"
    return post

@story
def twitter_story(social_media: "SocialMedia") -> str:
    content = "Hello, Twitter!"
    post = f"Posting to Twitter: {content}, by {social_media.username}"
    return post


@dataclass(frozen=True)
class SocialMedia:
    username: str
    story: Optional[Callable[["SocialMedia"], str]] = None

    def timeline(self) -> str:
        if self.story is None:
            raise ValueError("No story function set for this social media.")
        return self.story(self)


def print_all_stories(social_media: SocialMedia) -> None:
    for story_item in stories:
        print(story_item(social_media))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    user = SocialMedia("John", story=instagram_story)
    print(user.timeline())
    print_all_stories(user)
```

This approach allows us to define multiple story functions and register them using the `@story` decorator.
The `SocialMedia` class can then use these registered story functions to post content to different platforms.
This design pattern is flexible and allows for easy extension by simply adding new story functions without modifying the existing code.

# Conclusion

The Strategy design pattern is a powerful way to encapsulate algorithms and make them interchangeable.
By defining a common interface and implementing concrete strategies, we can easily switch between different
algorithms without modifying the client code. This approach adheres to the open-closed principle and
promotes maintainability and scalability in our codebase.
